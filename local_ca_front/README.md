# Getting Started with Local Chat Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Why?

1. When I started my freelancing project, The React Developer i Outsourced the Job too refused to help integrate a chat system directly into the laravel application, so i built a seprate chat service that connects to the backend and handled only chats. So this brought the idea of local chat server , a ready made application you can add to your application.
